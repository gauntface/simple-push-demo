Super Simple Service Worker Push Demo
=======

The name says it all, the demo is:

- Bare bones
- Basic UI
- Shows notifications
- Breaks fairly regularly on Canary (tested on 2014/12/04)

You can curl the push request API with:

curl --data "title=Hello World&message=Yes you Matt" http://localhost:8080/push
